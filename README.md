# Virtual-Try-On-Application-using-Flask-Twilio-and-Gradio
This repository contains the code for a virtual try-on application built using Flask, Twilio's WhatsApp API, and Gradio's virtual try-on model. Users can send images via WhatsApp to try on garments virtually, and the results are sent back to them.

## Features
- Receive images of a person and a garment via WhatsApp.
- Use Gradioâ€™s API to generate virtual try-on results.
- Return the result image to the user via WhatsApp.
- Uses Twilio Sandbox for WhatsApp for easy prototyping and testing.

## Technologies Used
- **Flask**: Backend server to handle requests and interact with Twilio and Gradio.
- **Twilio API**: To send and receive WhatsApp messages and media.
- **Gradio**: For interacting with the virtual try-on model.
- **Ngrok**: For exposing the local server to the internet for WhatsApp interaction.
- **OpenCV**: For handling images.
